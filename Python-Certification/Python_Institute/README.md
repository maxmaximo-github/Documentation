Chapter 1

* Computers have their own language, too, called machine language, which is very rudimentary.

* A complete set of known commands is called an instruction list, sometimes abbreviated ***IL***.

* Machine learning are developed by humans.

* No computer is currently capable of creating a new language.

What makes a language?
***
* an **alphabet**: a set of symbols used to build words of a certain language.
* a **lexis**: a set of words the language offers its user.
* a **syntax**: a set of rules used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence.
* **semantics**: a set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense.

The ***IL*** is, in fact, ** the alphabet of a machine language. This is the simplest and mos primary set of symbols we can use to give commands to a computer.

* High-level programming language are the least somewhat similar to natural ones in that they use symbols, words and conventions readable to humans.

There are two different ways to **transforming a program from a high-level programming language into machine language**:

* **COMPILATION** - the source program is translated once by getting file containing the machine code; now you can distribute the file worldwide, the program that perfoms this translation is called a compiler or translator.

* **INTERPRETATION** - you can translate the source program each time it has to be run; the program performing this kind of transformation is called an interpreter, as it interprets the code very time it is intended to be executed; it also means that you cannot just distribute the source code as-is, because the end-user also needs the interpreter to execute it.

* Python is an **interpreted language**. This means that it inherits all the described advantages and siadvantages. Of course, it adds some of its unique features to both sets.

* If you want to program in Python, you'll need the Python interpreter. You won't be able to run your code without. Fortunately, ***Python is free***. this is one of its most important advantages.
