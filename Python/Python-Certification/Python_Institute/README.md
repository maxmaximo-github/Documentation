Chapter 1

* Computers have their own language, too, called machine language, which is very rudimentary.

* A complete set of known commands is called an instruction list, sometimes abbreviated ***IL***.

* Machine learning are developed by humans.

* No computer is currently capable of creating a new language.

What makes a language?
***
* an **alphabet**: a set of symbols used to build words of a certain language.
* a **lexis**: a set of words the language offers its user.
* a **syntax**: a set of rules used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence.
* **semantics**: a set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense.

The ***IL*** is, in fact, ** the alphabet of a machine language. This is the simplest and mos primary set of symbols we can use to give commands to a computer.

* High-level programming language are the least somewhat similar to natural ones in that they use symbols, words and conventions readable to humans.

There are two different ways to **transforming a program from a high-level programming language into machine language**:

* **COMPILATION** - the source program is translated once by getting file containing the machine code; now you can distribute the file worldwide, the program that perfoms this translation is called a compiler or translator.

* **INTERPRETATION** - you can translate the source program each time it has to be run; the program performing this kind of transformation is called an interpreter, as it interprets the code very time it is intended to be executed; it also means that you cannot just distribute the source code as-is, because the end-user also needs the interpreter to execute it.

* Python is an **interpreted language**. This means that it inherits all the described advantages and siadvantages. Of course, it adds some of its unique features to both sets.

* If you want to program in Python, you'll need the Python interpreter. You won't be able to run your code without. Fortunately, ***Python is free***. this is one of its most important advantages.

What is Python?
***
Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming.

Who created Python?
***
Python was created by Guido van Rossum. Of course Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself.

Python goals
***
In 1999, Guido van Roussum definesd his goals for Python.

* an ***easy and intuitive*** language just as powerfull as those of the major competitors.
* ***open source***, so anyone can contribute to its development.
* code that is as ***understandable*** as plain English.
* ***suitable for everyday tasks***, allowing for short development times.

Python isn't a young language anymore. It's mature and trustworthy.

What makes Python special?
***
* it's ***easy to learn*** - the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it's possible to start the actual programming faster.
* it's ***easy to teach*** - the teaching workload is smaller than that needed by other languages; this means that the teacher can put more emphasis on general (language-independent) programming techniques, not wasting energy on exotic tricks, strange exceptions and incomprehensible rules
* it's ***easy to use*** for writing new software - it's often possible to write code faster when using Python.
* it's ***easy to understand*** - it's also often easier to understand someone else's code faster if it is written in Python.
* it's ***easy to obtain, install and deploy*** - Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.

Of course, Python has its drawbacks, too:
* it's not a speed demon - Python does not deliver exceptional performance
* in some cases it may be resistant to some simpler testing techniques- this may mean that debugging Python code can be more difficult thant with other languages; fortunately, making mistakes is also harder in Python.
